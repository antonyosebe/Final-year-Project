The important difference is that the paperboard is combined with polyethylene (#4 or LDPE), a type of plastic that helps maintain the paper structure of the container when it is exposed to cold temperatures. While good for packaging food, this plastic is not easily separated from the paperboard, so it shouldn't be in your recycling bin."],
